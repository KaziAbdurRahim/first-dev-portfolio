                In the heart of Dhaka, voices rise,
                A chorus of youth, their spirits high.
                For justice, for change, they march in stride,
                Their peaceful plea, a nation's pride.

                They stand for rights, with banners unfurled,
                A new chapter in freedom, bravely heralded.
                In unity, they claim their future's mold,
                A tale of courage, by students told.

                    <pre>
In shadows cast by broken dreams,
Where youthful voices silent scream.
Beneath the skies of Dhaka's grief,
A tale unfolds, beyond belief.

Innocence met with brutal might,
A massacre beneath the night.
For justice sought, their lives they gave,
Now rest they do, in early grave.

The streets once filled with vibrant cries,
Now echo with the mothers' sighs.
A nation's heart, so deeply scarred,
By violence cruel, and justice marred.

The blood-stained soil, a testament,
To dreams and hopes so violently spent.
Yet in the whispers of the breeze,
Their courage lives, and wonâ€™t appease.

We mourn their loss, but stand anew,
With burning hearts and vision true.
For in their names, we fight the wrong,
In memory, we grow so strong.

Let not their sacrifice be vain,
From tears and blood, we break our chain.
In shadows deep, where justice died,
Their legacy, our beacon, guide.
